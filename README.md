This repository demonstrates a structured approach to validating and cleaning intraday FX data prior to any modeling or signal research.
The focus is on timestamp integrity, OHLC consistency, gap detection, alignment across assets, and common sources of data leakage.
The goal is to ensure data is fit for cross-asset volatility and lead–lag analysis.
